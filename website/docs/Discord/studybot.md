I want to study with a pomodoro timer, how do I do that?

First, join one of the study rooms in the `STUDY CENTRE`

Once you have joined, run a `!pomodoro` command in the `#study-lounge` to set your timer.

Use the the format `!pomodoro <study><break>`

e.g. `!pomodoro 50,10` for a `50` min study session with a `10` min break.

You will see this in the `#study-lounge` if it is successful:
